Welcome to the tenzies game! This is a simple game where you have to first pick a dice and click on it to hold it. Then roll the other dice to get the same number as the dice you held. If you get the same number, keep holding those dice and roll the remaining ones until you have holded all the dice. Fastest one to do it wins!
